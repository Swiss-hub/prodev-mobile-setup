```bash
cd prodev-mobile-setup
mkdir prodev-mobile-app-0x00

Created a new Expo project named app-example using the latest Expo Router template:

Chose the Expo Router template when prompted.

This generated the app-example directory containing all starter files.

<Text>** First App Created**</Text>
(replaced the default Welcome! text)

From inside the project:

bash
Copy code
cd app-example
npx expo start
Scanned the QR code with the Expo Go app on an Android phone.

Confirmed the app displayed: First App Created.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Reset the Project
Ran:

bash

npm run reset-project
üîÑ Observations on reset-project
node_modules folder was removed.

Cached build files and Metro bundler cache were cleared.

package-lock.json remained, but dependencies had to be reinstalled (npm install) before running again.

Purpose: provides a clean slate for troubleshooting or preparing a fresh build.
